I have a SQLite database with one table:

# Run .schema from your sqlite3 prompt to output the schema
CREATE TABLE [activities] (
   [customer_id] TEXT,
   [stream_start_date] TEXT,
   [stream_checkout_date] TEXT,
   [country] TEXT,
   [product] TEXT,
   [source_name] TEXT,
   [cancel_email_sent_date] TEXT,
   [expiry_date] TEXT,
   [last_activity_date] TEXT,
   [last_ticket_bought_date] TEXT,
   [last_gift_date] TEXT
);

# Describe the table
It represents the activity of a customer in a streaming service. The columns are:

# Describe each column using terms that are likely to be used in questions
